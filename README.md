Implement a GetTypeOfDigitsSequence extension method that obtains in the form of a string information about the type of sequence that the digits of a given integer number represents.  Restriction: Don't use arrays.



     For example, 

23456789L -> "Strictly Increasing."
long.MinValue ->  "Unordered."
long.MaxValue -> "Unordered."
9876543210L -> "Strictly Decreasing."
111111111111111L -> "Monotonous."
8765432110L -> "Decreasing."
11234567889L -> "Increasing."
1L ->  "One digit number."
-1L -> "One digit number."
